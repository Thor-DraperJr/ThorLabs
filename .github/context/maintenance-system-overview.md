# üîß ThorLabs Project Maintenance System

## Quick Start
```bash
# Basic maintenance commands
./scripts/maintenance.sh health    # Quick health check
./scripts/maintenance.sh report    # Full audit report
./scripts/maintenance.sh fix       # Auto-fix issues
./scripts/maintenance.sh stats     # Project statistics
```

## üìã Complete System Overview

### 1. Automated Audit Script
**File:** `scripts/audit-project.sh`
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive project health analysis
- **Frequency:** Weekly (automated) + on-demand
- **Modes:** `--report-only` (safe) or `--fix-issues` (makes changes)
- **Output:** Detailed markdown report with severity classifications

**Checks Include:**
- Documentation duplicates, outdated content, minimal files
- Script permissions, shebangs, git activity
- Infrastructure naming, orphaned files, compilation status
- Security vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets
- File organization, workflow health

### 2. GitHub Automation
**File:** `.github/workflows/project-audit.yml`
- **Schedule:** Every Sunday 6 AM UTC
- **Triggers:** Manual dispatch with mode selection
- **Actions:** Creates/updates GitHub issues for findings
- **Artifacts:** Stores audit reports for 30 days

### 3. Maintenance Helper
**File:** `scripts/maintenance.sh`
- **Purpose:** User-friendly interface for common maintenance tasks
- **Commands:** health, report, fix, stats, cleanup, checklist
- **Integration:** Works with audit script and GitHub workflows

### 4. Maintenance Policy
**File:** `.github/context/project-maintenance-policy.md`
- **Purpose:** Formal maintenance procedures and SLAs
- **Coverage:** Schedules, severity classification, response times
- **Metrics:** Health indicators and performance tracking

### 5. Manual Review Process
**File:** `.github/context/project-review-checklist.md`
- **Purpose:** Structured monthly/quarterly reviews
- **Scope:** Deep analysis beyond automated checks
- **Output:** Actionable improvement plans

- Minor inconsistencies
- Process improvements

## üìÖ Maintenance Schedule

### Automated
- **Weekly Audit:** Every Sunday 6 AM UTC
- **Security Scans:** On every push to main
- **Dependency Updates:** Monthly (first Monday)

### Manual
- **Monthly Deep Review:** First Friday of each month
- **Quarterly Architecture Review:** End of each quarter
- **Annual Policy Update:** December

## üìä Success Metrics

### Health Indicators
- **Zero Critical Issues**: < 2 hours to resolution
- **Total Issue Count**: Trending downward over time  
- **Documentation Coverage**: > 90% of features documented
- **Security Score**: Zero exposed secrets/vulnerabilities

### Performance Metrics
- **Audit Runtime**: < 5 minutes for full project scan
- **Fix Success Rate**: > 90% of automatic fixes successful
- **False Positive Rate**: < 5% of flagged issues invalid
- **Time to Resolution**: Critical < 2h, High < 8h, Medium < 1 week

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Run `./scripts/maintenance.sh health` before major changes**
2. **Address critical issues immediately (< 2 hours)**
3. **Use automated fixes for routine maintenance**
4. **Schedule monthly manual reviews**
5. **Monitor GitHub workflow notifications**
6. **Keep maintenance policy updated**

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Initial Assessment**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/maintenance.sh report
   # Review findings and establish baseline
   ```

2. **Enable Automation**
   - GitHub workflow is already configured
   - Monitor for issue notifications

3. **Establish Routine**
   - Weekly: Check audit results
   - Monthly: Complete manual checklist
   - Quarterly: Review and update policies

4. **Team Integration**
   - Add maintenance checks to sprint planning
   - Include audit metrics in retrospectives
   - Train team on maintenance commands
