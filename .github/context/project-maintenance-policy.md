## 🚨 Severity Classification

### Critical Issues (🚨)
- **Security vulnerabilities**
- **Hardcoded secrets**
- **Infrastructure failures**
- **Data exposure risks**

**Response Time:** Immediate (< 2 hours)
**Escalation:** Automatic GitHub issue + email notification

### High Priority (⚠️)
- **Performance degradation**
- **Significant technical debt**
- **Compliance violations**
- **Multiple interconnected issues**

**Response Time:** Same day (< 8 hours)
**Escalation:** GitHub issue with high priority label

### Medium Priority (💡)
- **Optimization opportunities**
- **Documentation gaps**
- **Minor inconsistencies**
- **Process improvements**

**Response Time:** Within week
**Escalation:** Standard GitHub issue

## 🔧 Maintenance Actions

### Automated Fixes
The audit script can automatically fix:
- File permissions (executable scripts)
- Basic formatting issues
- Standard project structure
- Simple naming inconsistencies

### Manual Interventions Required
- Content consolidation
- Architecture refactoring
- Security policy updates
- Business logic changes

## 📊 Maintenance Metrics

### Health Indicators
- **Zero Critical Issues**: < 2 hours to resolution
- **Total Issue Count**: Trending downward over time
- **Documentation Coverage**: > 90% of features documented
- **Security Score**: Zero exposed secrets/vulnerabilities

### Performance Metrics
- **Audit Runtime**: < 5 minutes for full project scan
- **Fix Success Rate**: > 90% of automatic fixes successful
- **False Positive Rate**: < 5% of flagged issues invalid
- **Time to Resolution**: Critical < 2h, High < 8h, Medium < 1 week

## 🛠️ Tools and Integration

### Primary Tools
- **Audit Script**: `./scripts/audit-project.sh`
- **GitHub Workflow**: `.github/workflows/project-audit.yml`
- **Issue Tracking**: GitHub Issues with `project-audit` label

### Integration Points
- **VS Code**: Automated audit on workspace open
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit audit for critical issues
- **CI/CD**: Audit gates in deployment pipeline

## 👥 Responsibilities

### Project Owner
- Review and approve maintenance policy updates
- Prioritize critical and high-priority issues
- Allocate resources for quarterly reviews

### Development Team
- Respond to audit findings within SLA
- Implement manual fixes and improvements
- Provide feedback on audit accuracy

### Automation

- Apply approved automatic fixes

## 🔄 Process Workflow

### Weekly Cycle
1. **Sunday**: Automated audit runs
2. **Monday**: Review audit results and prioritize
3. **Tuesday-Thursday**: Address high/critical issues
4. **Friday**: Review progress and plan improvements

### Monthly Cycle
1. **Week 1**: Deep manual review session
2. **Week 2-3**: Implement identified improvements
3. **Week 4**: Update policies and documentation

### Quarterly Cycle

2. **Month 3**: Architecture review and planning
3. **End of Quarter**: Metrics review and policy updates

## 📈 Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loops
- Audit script effectiveness monitoring
- False positive/negative analysis
- Developer productivity impact assessment
- Security incident correlation

### Policy Evolution
- Quarterly policy review and updates
- Tool capability enhancement
- Process optimization based on metrics
- Industry best practice adoption

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Initial Setup
1. Run manual audit: `./scripts/audit-project.sh --report-only`
2. Review findings and establish baseline
3. Enable GitHub workflow
4. Schedule first monthly review

### Daily Operations
1. Check for audit issue notifications
2. Address critical issues immediately
3. Plan high-priority work in daily standups
4. Track progress in project board

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Critical Issue Detected**: Stop all other work
2. **Security Incident**: Follow security response plan
3. **Infrastructure Failure**: Activate disaster recovery
4. **Multiple Critical Issues**: Escalate to project owner
